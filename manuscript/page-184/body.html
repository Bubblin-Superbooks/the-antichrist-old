<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>--It is easy to see just what, by this logic, was the first thing to come into the world:--"sin."... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole "moral order of the world," was set up against science--against the deliverance of man from priests.... Man must not look outward; he must look inward. He must not look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to learn about them; he must not look at all; he must suffer.... And he must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.--Away with physicians! What is needed is a Saviour.--The concept of guilt and punishment, including the doctrines of "grace," of "salvation," of "forgiveness"--lies through and through, and absolutely without psychological reality--were devised to destroy man's sense of causality: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and effect!--And not an attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty in hate and love!</p></div> </div>
