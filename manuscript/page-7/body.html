<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, "Ecce Homo," "The Antichrist" is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form. Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to have constituted the first volume of his long-projected magnum opus, "The Will to Power." His full plan for this work, as originally drawn up, was as follows:</p><p>Vol. I. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.</p><p>Vol. II. The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement.</p></div> </div>
